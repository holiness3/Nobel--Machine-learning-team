Machine learning projects in Nobel
Younger interns feel unsafe and uncomfortable when paired with much older individuals, which has a negative impact on their satisfaction and performance. The objective of this project is to create an age-based grouping that will make all interns feel comfortable and safe, and the goal is to develop a machine learning model to cluster data according to age range aiding in better intern pairing and this should be exclusive for different cohorts.
